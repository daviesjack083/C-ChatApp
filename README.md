# Chat Application in C#
I wrote this real time C# chat app a couple of years ago while learning the language. I'm adding it to my github as a side project to refine and improve upon until it's no longer embarrassing. Please note my focus is currently on the server-side, and so the client is shocking and will be replaced in the near future with a pretty (hopefully sophisticated) web solution.

## Implemented Features
- Real-time messaging
- Basic Encryption

## To-Do
### Core Stuff
- Transition current client solution to a cleaner Vue.js web client
- Devise a better solution rather than hard coding the encryption key (duh!)
- Plot a more scalable threading solution (Probably async / FIFO queue)
- Add a factory pattern to handle user commands

### Potential Future Features
- Add colours
- Add rooms
- Add permissions/roles system for rooms
- Add more commands
