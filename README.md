# Chat Application in C#
A real time chat application written in C# I wrote some time ago when beginning to learn the language. I will be gradually improving and refining it. 

## Features
- Real-time messaging
- Basic Encryption

## To-Do
- Store the encryption key in code no longer -_-
- Transition simple threading to an asynchronous/thread pool solution
- Add a graceful shutdown for the server class
- Improve upon the basic error handling
- Add colours
- Add rooms
- Add permissions
- Add some basic commands
