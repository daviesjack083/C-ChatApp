# Chat Application in C#
A real time chat application written in C# I wrote some time ago when beginning to learn the language. I will be gradually improving and refining it. 

## Features

- Basic AES Encryption

### Commands
- /name desired_username

## To-Do
- Migrate the architecture to an MVC model for extensibility 
- Find a better place to store the encryption key
- Transition simple threading to an asynchronous/thread pool solution
- Add colours
- Add rooms
- Add permissions/roles system for rooms
- Add more commands
